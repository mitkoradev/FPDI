Modified version 2.3.6 of FPDI

https://github.com/Setasign/FPDI

Added support for compressed XREF table and object streams

A few customers of mine have asked for using pdf templates and adding new information,  like forms.

After finally finding a solution with FPDI and FPDF it was still bothersome that many pdfs were not supported ( for example ones that Firefox saves )

After spending more time to find some solition I finally read the specification and added support for the files I needed.
